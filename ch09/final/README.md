# CS110 Final Exam

## SHORT DESCRIPTION

This is a program that you can use to search up anime series and characters. Using IMDb's API, it will return general info about that show including the rating, plot, and genre. Then I use AnimeChan to grab a random quote from the anime series/character. 

## KNOWN BUGS AND INCOMPLETE PARTS _(list any known bugs or non-working parts)_

It takes a few seconds to query IMDb for data. 

The search feature relies on AnimeChan's search feature which only matches exact strings. AnimeChan's database is also very limited so many anime series and characters might not be found.

## REFERENCES _(any resources you use outside of class materials)_

[IMDb API Documentation](https://imdb-api.com/API)

## MISCELLANEOUS COMMENTS _(anything else you would like the grader to know)_
Some examples of anime in AnimeChan's database include: ["naruto", "one piece", "bleach", "gintama", "attack on titan", "evangelion"]
